# Code Context

Generated: 01/07/2025, 11:34:32 am

This document provides AI agents and developers with essential context about this codebase. 
It addresses the "context deficit" problem where AI lacks architectural, historical, and implicit knowledge.

**For AI Agents:** Read this file first before making any code changes. Use `code-context search` for specific queries.

## Quick Start for AI Agents

### Project Overview
- **Main Language:** TypeScript
- **Frameworks:** None detected
- **Test Framework:** Vitest
- **Build Tools:** Docker Compose

### Development Patterns
- **Commit Convention:** Conventional Commits (feat, fix, etc.)
- **Architecture Pattern:** Standard structure
- **Active Contributors:** MAGI System, James Peter, magi
- **Code Health:** 1 high-risk files, 59 medium-risk files

### Before Making Changes
1. Review high-risk files: controller/src/server/managers/container_manager.ts
2. Follow commit convention: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)
3. Run tests: Check package.json for test command
4. Run formatter before committing

### Critical Information
‚ö†Ô∏è Recent failures: Test failures

üîí Security-focused development detected

### Style Guide
‚úÖ Auto-formatting available - run formatter before commit
Linters: Prettier, ESLint

## Key Constraints

### ‚õî Never Do This
- Test failures (failed in 589dab1)
- Test failures (failed in a614133)
- This file has recurring issues - consider refactoring or deeper investigation (failed in ca7e13f74a35de9dfe6c34931ddde9b004c0c167)
- This file has recurring issues - consider refactoring or deeper investigation (failed in 59a3085937bd631d3733448b51bf4270169e24a5)
- This file has recurring issues - consider refactoring or deeper investigation (failed in ca7e13f74a35de9dfe6c34931ddde9b004c0c167)

### ‚úÖ Always Do This
- TypeScript: Strict mode: Strict type checking enabled
- Line endings: Use lf line endings
- Trailing whitespace: Trim trailing whitespace

### Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Always validate user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
